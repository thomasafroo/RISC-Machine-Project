# Simple RISC Machine

This project implements a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) using SystemVerilog and can be tested using the Intel DE1-SoC development board.
The RISC machine can execute a set of instructions from the ARMv7 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It contains a datapath, finite state machine controller, and support for read-write memory.

This project was done in collaboration with my lab partner, Jackson Rockford, for CPEN 211: Introduction to Microcomputers.

Important: viewers should be mindful of the Academic Integrity Policy for CPEN 211 and UBC ECE.
